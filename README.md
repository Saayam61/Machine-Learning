Projects
Rock vs Mine Prediction
In this project, we use sonar data to classify objects as either rocks or mines. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature extraction,
model training, and evaluation.

Diabetes Prediction
This project involves building a model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various medical parameters. The notebook covers data preprocessing,
exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
